                            <p>From a niche scenario case of trying to translate a Korean word for "epilepsy" to English, we realized that common available tools like Google Translate did not have the cultural or technical sensitivity needed for high quality medical translation. In this regard, human translators are currently irreplaceable. Realizing that reliance on ad hoc translators is common in the medical field, we reached out to find out about different experiences people had as translators. We identified 3 key findings:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points numbered-list">
                                <li>Second generation children of immigrant parents often served older family members as translators, their ages ranging anywhere from 9 to 30.</li>
                                <li>Federally funded centers are technically required to offer professional translation services, but many do not, as the laws are not enforced. As a result, many patients end up relying on ad hoc translators.</li>
                                <li>There is a high correlation between LEP and at-risk status. "At-risk" refers to patients who are uninsured, undocumented, or of low-SES background.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <!-- expert interviews -->
                        <div class="h3-section">
                            <h3>Expert Interviews</h3>
                            <p>Speaking to local health centers and hospitals helped us set us set realistic constraints and expectations for this project. We were able to see a bit into how healthcare works, and design with the existing system in mind.</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points numbered-list">
                                <li>We talked to a diverse range of health centers who served communities with varying degrees of LEP visibility. For example, <a href="http://www.upmc.com/locations/community/family-health-centers/Pages/bloomfield-garfield.aspx">UPMC St. Margaret Bloomfield-Garfield Family Health Center</a> serves a medically underserved area with many LEP and low-SES patients, so the doctors are knowledgable about immigrant needs and are well-equipped to serve patients in other languages.</li>
                                <li>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.upmc.com/locations/hospitals/st-margaret/Pages/default.aspx">UPMC Aspinwall</a> has a low visibility of LEP patients, but they have a higher elderly population and their patients struggle with health literacy. Here, we took away insights about addressing more general health literacy problems as well.</li>
                                <li>Of all the health centers we talked to, the <a href="https://squirrelhillhealthcenter.org/">Squirrel Hill Health Center</a> catered the most to LEP patients. Their multilingual staff provide primary and preventive healthcare and case management for immigrants of all ages who arrive in Pittsburgh, and they have a vast network of connections with other local services.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>After our interviews, we synthesized our findings and soon realized that it was difficult to define a “typical” doctor’s visit due to the varying circumstances of our users.</p>

                        <p>If we had time to develop POLLY further, I would love to investigate partnerships with existing medical translation services and Pittsburgh's healthcare infrastructure. It'd be interesting to learn how to culminate relationships with health and relocation centers to build a trusted network of resources for LEP clients. Additionally, throughout the course of the project we learned how diverse medical needs are in different geographic areas, so I would like to explore designing POLLY for more unique and localized needs.</p>
