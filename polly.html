                            <p>From personal experiences, my team found a need to address the emotional and cultural barriers preventing proper communication between American doctors and low-English proficiency patients, who often rely on unqualified friends or family to be "ad hoc" translators, in place of a professional.</p>

                            <p>We designed 2 touchpoints: </p>
                            <p>1) The <span class="bold">pocket course</span> provides ad hocs with quick professional tips for medical interpretation. Found in waiting rooms or doctor’s offices, this piece also directs them over to the mobile app.</p>
                            <p>2) The <span class="bold"> mobile app</span> offers POLLY's full services, allowing users to make requests for professional translators, translate more effectively, and track the patient's medical activity.</p>

                            <p>We began with background research to gauge the scale of this problem: how many people it affected, and to what extent.</p>
                            <p class="statistic">Over 60 million people in the US are bilingual, and over 40% of them are considered Low English Proficient (LEP).</p>
                            <p>We guessed that if most people had family translate their appointments, like we'd seen, then many weren't getting reliable information and follow-up. The long-term effects of this oversight include <span class="bold">unfilled prescriptions</span>, the <span class="bold">endangered health</span> of millions, and <span class="bold">inflated costs</span> for delayed treatment.</p>

                            <p>Speaking with people who have acted as translators in health settings (interviews conducted by our team in pairs), we learned more about the factors that cause them stress during medical visits.</p>
                            <p class="statistic">Out of 13 interviewees, only 2 had been offered professional translation services. Neither opted to use them.</p>
