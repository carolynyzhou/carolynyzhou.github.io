Despite this risk, patients often ask unqualified, bilingual caretakers to fill in as "ad hoc" translators instead of a professional. <span class="bold">We aimed to alleviate the factors contributing to this problem, ranging from discomfort to lack of awareness. </span></p>

                            <p>We reached out to people who have acted as non-professional translators (our target users) for interviews. We found that second generation children of immigrant parents often translated for older family members. As immigrants, many LEP patients also carry “at-risk” status (uninsured, undocumented, or of low-SES background), making medical visits even more stressful. Further, many federally funded centers do not offer professional translation services without prompting, as the laws requiring this action are not enforced.</p>

                            <p>We saw great diversity in how health centers handled medical translation, depending on the communities surrounding them. Doctors working in medically underserved areas seemed more knowledgeable about immigrant needs and were better equipped to serve them. Additionally, some clinics were much stricter than others on consulting professional translators and had more efficient systems to reach them.</p>
