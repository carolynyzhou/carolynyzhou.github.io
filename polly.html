                            <p>We reached out to people who have acted as non-professional translators (our target users) and had 3 key findings:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points">
                                <li>Second generation children of immigrant parents often served older family members as translators.</li>
                                <li>Federally funded centers are technically required to offer professional translation services, but many do not as the laws are not enforced.</li>
                                <li>There is a strong correlation between LEP and "at-risk" status (uninsured, undocumented, or of low-SES background).</li>

                            <p>As a contrast, we spoke to professionals at health centers in communities with varying English-proficiency levels, and we saw great diversity in how they operated. Doctors working in medically underserved areas seemed more knowledgeable about immigrant needs and were better equipped to serve them. Some clinics were strict on consulting professional translators and had efficient systems to reach them, while others defaulted to using family members.</p>

                            <p>We crafted a “crash course” filled with translation tips from professionals, designed to feel reassuring and fit in the user’s pocket. Our development process involved test prints, paper prototypes, and drafting the course’s content.</p>

                            <p>If we had time to develop POLLY further, I would love to investigate partnerships with existing medical translation services and Pittsburgh's healthcare infrastructure. It would be interesting to learn how to culminate relationships with health and relocation centers to build a trusted network of resources for LEP clients. Additionally, throughout the course of the project we learned how diverse medical needs are in different geographic areas, so I would like to explore POLLY's concept for more unique and localized needs.</p>
