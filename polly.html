                            <p>Initially we placed the patient in the center as the primary stakeholder affected, identifying healthcare providers and caretakers as supporters. However, as we researched and developed further we realized we were really designing for the friends and family who act as translators, in order to help them help the patient.</p>

                            <p>We realized early on that tools like Google Translate did not always have the cultural awareness for accurate translation and sometimes sensitive topics. <span class="bold">Human understanding and empathy were irreplaceable</span>. We reached out to people who have acted as translators and identified 3 key findings:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points">
                                <li>Second generation children of immigrant parents often served older family members as translators.</li>
                                <li>Federally funded centers are technically required to offer professional translation services, but many do not as the laws are not enforced.</li>
                                <li>There is a strong correlation between LEP and "at-risk" status (uninsured, undocumented, or of low-SES background).</li>

                            <p>We spoke to staff members at health centers serving communities with varying levels of English proficiency, and we were able to understand more about the healthcare system and medical translation services.</p>
                            <p>After talking to healthcare professionals, we realized that it was difficult to define a “typical” doctor’s visit due to the varying circumstances of patients and the facilities they visit. For example, doctors working in medically underserved areas might be more knowledgeable about immigrant needs and be more well-equipped to serve them. Some clinics are stricter on consulting ad hocs than others. Our challenge became to design for all kinds of translation needs.</p>

We received positive feedback on the Pocket Course's message and language, and the presence of the app as a digital tool. However, this particular center strongly opposes the use of ad hoc translators, so they might appreciate more emphasis on the translation resources section in the app.</p>

                        <p>If we had time to develop POLLY further, I would love to investigate partnerships with existing medical translation services and Pittsburgh's healthcare infrastructure. It would be interesting to learn how to culminate relationships with health and relocation centers to build a trusted network of resources for LEP clients. Additionally, throughout the course of the project we learned how diverse medical needs are in different geographic areas, so I would like to explore POLLY's concept for more unique and localized needs.</p>
