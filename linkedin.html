                            <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
                            <p>To begin, I listed questions I had from the reading prompt:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points numbered-list">
                                <li>What do recruiters need to know to post a job?</li>
                                <li>How do recruiters reach candidates who are relevant to the job posted?</li>
                                <li>What do candidates want to see in a job post?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I conducted some preliminary research on what recruiters might look for in their candidates, and created lists of things that recruiters might look for in their candidates. I listed some criteria and initial thoughts based on my experience job hunting and on LinkedIn’s existing search filters. This process helped me begin to think about information hierarchy and the posting process, and questions for real users.</p>

                            <h3>Recruiter Interviews</h3>
                            <p>Sample questions:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points">
                                <li>How do you know what criteria is needed for a job?</li>
                                <li>After posting a job, how much is receiving applications vs. how much is reaching out?</li>
                                <li>How do you know who is a relevant candidate? How do you identify if a candidate is a good fit?</li>
                                <li>Who do you find to be most responsive, and can you predict it?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="images/linkedin/interviews-1.png" id="image-before-text">
                            <p>Job posting involves targeting the right people using the right criteria. To post jobs, recruiters first need a clear understanding of the requirements of the job they’re posting, so that they can provide strong descriptions and accurate criteria. In some cases recruiters look to current employees’ networks or referrals to find people with similar backgrounds to people they already know. These are more reliable ways to find relevant, high-quality candidates.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I noticed that recruiters often rely on people they already know to finding quality candidates, so I wondered if there was a better way to communicate about the job opportunity with those people during the posting process. Also, was there a better way to gauge who’s interested and effectively reach out to them?</p>

                        <!-- candidate interviews -->

                            <h3>Candidate Interviews</h3>
                            <p>I decided to talk to candidates as well because I wondered what they wanted to see in a job post, and whether that could inform the recruiter’s side to create more effective posts and potentially cut down work. Sample questions:</p>
                            <ul class="bullet-points">
                                <li>Where do you look for jobs? Do you use LinkedIn?</li>
                                <li>How do you determine if a job is a good fit for you?</li>
                                <li>What would you like to know about a job before you apply to it?</li>
                                <li>What is your general experience with recruiters (either contacting them or them contacting you)?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="images/linkedin/interviews-2.png" id="image-before-text">
                            <p>Most candidates have certain criteria in mind when job hunting, such as the job title or company name. Candidates enjoy hearing from people like them, such as past employees or people in the same field, to learn more about a job and a company. I wondered if there was a way for recruiters to show what candidates cared about more, and if they could reach people who were interested already based on criteria matches.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- competitive analysis -->
                        <div class="h3-section">
                            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <h4>LinkedIn</h4>
                            <p>I did some research on the recruiter’s side of LinkedIn, because I was not familiar with the interface. I looked at how recruiters create post jobs, how they manage and track candidates, and so on. Looking at existing job posts on LinkedIn, I also noticed that they are extremely text-heavy and cumbersome to read. One user I interviewed said most job descriptions are generic, and she doesn’t read them. Perhaps it’s not a good use of time for recruiters, then, to type these up.</p>
                            <div class="two-column">
                                <img src="images/linkedin/companalysis-linkedin1.png" class="left-image">

                            <br>
                            <h4>Indeed</h4>
                            <p>Indeed is the largest job board in the world, and its job posts are viewed by a huge pool of candidates. One thing I picked up about these job posts was that most of the fields are optional. This, in addition to the service being free for employers to use, made me question the quality of job postings. In comparison, LinkedIn marks many more required fields, making the search process easier for candidates, and maybe more difficult for recruiters up front but easier later when sorting through applicants.</p>

                            <br>
                            <h4>Facebook Jobs</h4>
                            <p>Facebook has an interesting method of targeting. Targeting people who “liked” certain pages reaches people with similar interests or backgrounds. The existence of Facebook Groups makes it easy to do something similar as well. Recruiters on Facebook can leverage social networks to reach distinct groups of people who will likely be interested in certain jobs, and at least one user mentioned his social network as his primary resource for finding job opportunities. LinkedIn has groups and job posting capabilities, but those posts don’t seem to be able to be as targeted for specific demographics, types of companies, candidate backgrounds, etc.</p>

                                <li><span class="bold">Social networks and relationships</span> are one of the most valuable resources to both recruiters and job seekers.

                        <p>For this challenge, I made informed decisions based on online research and a small sample of users, but I was aware that I was working off some assumptions. Given that my concept was emphasizing the value of social networks in job posting and recruiting, I would’ve liked to learn more about how well LinkedIn’s virtual networks reflect real-life social networks and interactions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If I had more time, I would conduct user tests with my prototype to measure its value and how graspable the concept is. To measure its success, I would track whether recruiters take a shorter time to complete a job post, and whether a higher percentage of candidates who respond to the post feel “relevant” to recruiters and hiring teams.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I’d also be interested in building a more complete end-to-end system, further exploring the concepts I touched on in my low-fidelity wireframes that could tie into the main posting process. For example, perhaps Jennifer could receive a notification and have a process for introducing people she knows to the recruiter, so Chris could get more referrals too.</p>
